MVT (file structure of Django)
1) Model // Everything related to DB
2) View // All logical work -- Controller that feeds DB content to display in templates (middleman)
3) Template // Which page you view or show

MVT has Views for receiving HTTP request and returning HTTP response.
Templates are used in MVT like Views are in MVC
Controller part is managed by the framework itself.
Modifications are easy
Suitable both small and large applications.
Flow is sometimes harder to understand as compared to MVC.
URL pattern mapping takes place.
Django uses MVT pattern.

_______________________________________________________________

... as opposed to MVC (Model View Controller)
1) Model // same
2) View // Which page you view/show
3) Controller // All logical work -- Controller

MVC has controller that drives both Model and View.
View tells how the user data will be presented.
In MVC, we have to write all the control specific code.
Modifications are difficult	
Suitable for development of large applications but not for small applications.	
Flow is clearly defined thus easy to understand.	
It doesnâ€™t involve mapping of URLs.	
Examples are ASP.NET MVC, Spring MVC etc.
